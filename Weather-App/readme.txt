This project is a weather app that takes the user's location, after permission 
is given, and brings up the weather for that area. It will display on the main
screen weather details including temperature, precipitation, and wind. It will
also display warnings if applicable to the area, such as freeze or flood 
warnings, which will display more when clicked with scrolling text. The buttons
on the bottom  will allow to toggle between the main screen, hourly data, and 
weekly data.
