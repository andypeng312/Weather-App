This is a weather app that uses the browser's geolocation data and uses the
Weather Underground API at http://api.wunderground.com/ to return weather data
at the user's location.

This app was made so that I could practice the following skills and techniques:
-jQuery
-AJAX requests
-using JSONP for CORS
-using a CSS reset
-CSS keyframe animations
-DOM manipulation

The app uses the Meyer's CSS Reset Stylesheet found at 
http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/ and a background pattern downloaded
from www.subtlepatterns.com.

The screenshot folder shows images of the final product.

Technologies used: HTML, jQuery, CSS, AJAX/JSONP
Estimated Lines of Code: 600
