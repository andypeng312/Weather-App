## Description of Project
This is a weather app that uses the browser's geolocation data and uses the
Weather Underground API at http://api.wunderground.com/ to return weather data
at the user's location.

This app was made so that I could practice the following skills and techniques:
*jQuery
*AJAX requests
*using JSONP for CORS
*using a CSS reset
*CSS keyframe animations
*DOM manipulation

The app uses the Meyer's CSS Reset Stylesheet found at 
http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/ and a background pattern downloaded
from http://www.subtlepatterns.com.
